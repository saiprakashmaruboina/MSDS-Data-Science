# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project uses PyCaret AutoML to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

## Process
- Loaded churn dataset
- Used PyCaret to compare multiple models
- Selected best model using AUC metric
- Finalized and saved the model
- Created Python module to predict churn probability
- Tested model with new_churn_data.csv

## Result
The selected model achieved the highest AUC score and successfully predicts churn probability for new customers.
